## Outline
- EU Rail pass (5 travel days)
    - Adding journeys or using the travel days without journeys
    - Caveats to the pass
    - Booking seat reservations
    - Spain does not allow you to book seat reservations online. Must use Renfe in person. Do bookings for *leaving* Spain as soon as you get to Spain so that seats do not sell out on the train you want to take.
